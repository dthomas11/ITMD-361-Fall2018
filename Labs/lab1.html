  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>

  

  <p>My name is David Thomas and this is my first introduction to coding in any form. So far it is extremely confusing and fast paced and I do not get a good feeling about it. Hopefully I can find someone to help me understand it otherwise I am going to have a really difficult career path in IT</p>
